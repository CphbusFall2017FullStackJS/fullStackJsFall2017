# Full Stack JavaScript - Fall 2017

*JavaScript is everywhere. Once a simple misunderstood language, used only for simple browser manipulations, it has now evolved along with the Web and finds itself entrenched in all modern browsers, complex Web applications, mobile apps, server-side applications, desktop applications and in emerging platforms like the Internet of Things*

This is the language we are going to "have a lot of fun with" in the coming months :-)

## How I have designed the course.

The course is divided up into ~~(6)~~ 5 periods, each with a specific topic and a number of exercises which will form the basis for the examination.

At least one period will be marked as non-compulsory, which mean you can replace it with a topic decided by yourself (must be approved by me).

You will find the description for the six periods on github, but please note that it WILL change, so don't count on it more than 1-2 lessons into the future. The documents for each period will also include all literature, exercises, links to slides etc.

## Learning Goals

Learning goals will be given for each of the periods as exam-questions. This should make it very easy to see what the expected outcome is, by the end of the semester.

Given how fast things evolve in the JavaScript world, the descriptions are not complete yet. The only promise I can give is; that by the end of a period, the goals for that period will be locked, so you can start preparing for the exam.

## What is expected from you in this course?

You are expected, each week to write a lot of different JavaScript code, and also to reflect about pros & cons, when, or when not to use a technology, etc. By the end of a period you must hand in a description covering the "reflection" parts from the syllabus + a Git-hub link with all code required for the period.

Before each lesson there will be articles to read, videos to watch, and sometimes software you should have installed before the lesson. I don't go through everything in my lessons, and I do assume you are prepared and have at least skimmed the readings and videos before a lesson.

## How to get your StudyPoints

You get (as usual) points for attendance and "doing stuff"

The new thing this semester is that: for the first two hand-inds, you as a class review the hand-ins, assign study points, and provide feedback to the student being reviewed.

The other new thing is, that that a person being reviewed, assign study points to the reviewer, related to the effort placed in providing a valid feedback.

#### Why do it this way

First, and least important. I simply don't have enough time to review more than 25 different hand-ins; six times throughout the semester.

More important, This is a very common discipline in real life, both to ensure quality in provided code and to share knowledge among developers. So do it TO LEARN.
