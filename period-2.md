# Period-2  
### Node.js Express and Testing with JavaScript   

*In this period we will introduce Express, a minimal and flexible node.js package, that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. We will also introduce the Mocha test framework together with a number of supplementing packages for assertions, mocking etc.*

# **13-09-Wednesday** 
* Using Express
* Express Middleware
* Server Side Rendering with Express


#### Before this lesson you should:

Before this lesson you should:
Watch watch this video (but see notes below first): [Server Side Apps with Node/Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QseHOX-5nJQ)
**Note:** things change extremely fast in the Node-world, so do the following to get a start project (instead of the instructions in the video)
* Create a new folder called express1
* Open a terminal and type:  npm init
* Enter an name (express1) when requested and app.js as entry point and use defaults for the rest
* Observe that this has created a file package.json in you folder.
* Now type npm install express --save
* Observe how this created a folder node_modules and added "something" to your package.json file
 
Now just follow the tutorial :-)

#### Before this lesson you should:
[Watch the Keynote speech](http://expressjs.com/)

### Read/Watch
If you like videos, since it gives you a chance to code along in your own speed, Lynda.com have a complete Node/Express course with some cool testing videos. 
Once logged in to Lynda search for "Node.js Essential Training" and watch:
* Testing with mocha and Chai
*	Asynchronous mocha testing
*	Mocking a server with NOCK
*	Code Coverage with Istanbul

As usual, the API descriptions should be your main resource for Mocha/Chai-questions.
*	[Mocha] (http://mochajs.org/ )
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/#method_throw)

# **27-09-Wednesday**
Short introduction to NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

#### Before this lesson you should:
I don't plan to talk about NoSQL in general, since Martin Fowler does it a lot better than me. Watch the video given below, either before or afther the lesson. It covers all "general questions" related to NoSQL

Usually I always recommend a local database for development. Since we only have one day for this topic however, I suggest you create a free account on mlab.com as outlined below, and use this account for all exercises related to MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Create an Account on mlab.com
- Log in
- Create new database
- Just choose amazon or Google or .. and SANDBOX
- Select Europe
- Give it a name
- Click on the database and select Users
- Add database user (otherwise we can’t connect)
- Then copy the standard URI (mongodb// …)
- Use this URL in your Code Examples

### Read/Watch
- [Introduction to NoSQL - Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)
- [What is Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications) (this is also one of the exercises for today)

### Exercises
 [What is Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications)
 
 *This is part of a larger tutorial, related to Express. Complete this tutorial (you also have a great deal of next week) to get a complete Express example including a database*
 
 [Express Tutorial Part 3: Using a Database (with Mongoose)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#Mongoose_primer)

BAsic Web-Security for Node Applications

#### Before this lesson you should:
To "tune" everyone into this new topic, we will make a **hacker competition**, focused around sessions hijacking and cross-site scripting. I will set up a siiiimpel session-driven server that you are allowed to attack and:

- First hacker who discover "secret" data from another user,  receives a GOOD beer ;-)

Before the lesson, you should read the following:

- XSS: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)
- Session Hijacking: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack
- A bit about it all and jwt's: https://stormpath.com/blog/build-secure-user-interfaces-using-jwts

A couple of quick videos that can be enjoyed on the couch

- Cross Site Scripting (XSS): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5l9lSnNMxg
- Cross Site Request Forgery Explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBihr41JTo
- Cookie Stealing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1QEs3mdJoc
