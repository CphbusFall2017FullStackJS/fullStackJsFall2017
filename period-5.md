# Period-5
## All the rest (Promises, async-await, functional programming with JS, MobX and (mainly) Redux)

*In this period we will introduce some of the more "advanced" features in JavaScript and related libraries. We will get a better understanding of promises, and learn to write our own promise-code. We will see how ES7 async-functions simplify the way to use promises. Finally we will introduce functional concepts like immutable and Redux as a way to handle data and state *
