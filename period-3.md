# Period-3  
## GraphQL    

*In this period we will introduce GraphQL, a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook and is now maintained by a large community of companies and individuals from all over the world.*

*This period will continue with the Express framework (day 1) and provide you with a (challenging) update of your REACT knowledge (day2+3) which you also need for period-4 (React Native)*

*The following videos are all part of a general introduction to GraphQL. If you don't like video's they are cool, because for each chapter there is a text version below the video. So pick your favourite. This will be the major reference for this period, so you should watch/read all chapters until the "Hands-on tutorials". This will be where we start next Wednesday (11-10). If you don't have time before this lesson it's OK, do as much as you have time for, and watch the rest before Wednesday.*
